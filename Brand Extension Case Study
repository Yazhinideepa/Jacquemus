Luxury Expansion Concept

Brand: Jacquemus
Project Type: Speculative Brand Extension
Role: Creative Strategist & Visual Director

This project is a strategic exploration of how Jacquemus could expand into the beauty category without diluting its identity.

Rather than approaching beauty as a commercial add-on, I examined Jacquemus as a lifestyle universe rooted in warmth, intimacy, Mediterranean light, and emotional minimalism. The objective was to translate those core brand codes into a sensory product category while maintaining restraint and narrative coherence.

The concept, “The Summer Body Ritual,” reframes beauty not as transformation or correction, but as seasonal ritual. Each product was designed to feel like a natural extension of the Jacquemus world sculptural, tactile, and emotionally grounded.
